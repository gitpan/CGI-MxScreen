. Description:

	Fixed HISTORY section.

	Random cleanup in named argument docs, to add the "=>" where it
	should be.

	Removed DFEATURE call from stringify hooks in the Exception
	hierarchy.  With Carp::Datum turned on with argument listing,
	that would cause an infinite recursion.

	Added sub-section on creation routine in the CGI::MxScreen::Screen
	manpage.

	Minor README reformatting.

	Forgot to list all t/ in MANIFEST.
